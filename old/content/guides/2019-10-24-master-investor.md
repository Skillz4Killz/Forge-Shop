## Introduction

One thing you also need to understand in the city is how investing works. As you continue to earn in your shop or from selling items in the market, you will more than likely invest. It will help improve your city's buildings and overall productivity rates. However, do not be afraid to invest as much as you can for if you were to leave your city, the investments you have made will be saved and carried with you.

### Understanding City Investments

A new method of upgrading buildings was introduced along with Tier 8 items: the Tick system.  This is where the cost of investing is based on how much you previously invested in that particular building. Eventually, we will all reach a certain Tick Cost that we consider to be "expensive" for us to do compared to other players. Some of us were just a little ahead of the others and we have to spend more, but it doesn't mean we can't invest anymore.

Most players still don't understand how upgrading buildings was now made easier in the new system. By making our low-invested members in that building buy out as much ticks as they can, the high-invested players will save millions of gold compared to the previous system where one person can do the building by himself and need to to work extra hard compared to the rest of the guild.

### Guild's Choice

In the Guild Settings menu, you can select a building to put the guild's choice on. As you invest in the chosen building, you will be granted a 10% off per tick!

The Guild's Choice can be moved by guildmasters and officers every 8 hours. This is important to remember because as the building is getting close to leveling up, you may not want to move the bonus there or you will wait 8 hours to choose another. Try to keep the bonus on buildings that require more money or the ones your guild is trying to focus on completing.

Here are two ways to move the Guild's Choice:

**A. Clicking on a building.** In this walk through, we will use Katarina/Jeweler as an example.

**B. Using the Guild Settings.** This time, let's use the Lumberyard!

## Types of Buildings

A building's level is determined by the total sum of every member's investment in that building. In your city, there are three types of it: Worker, Resource and Special buildings.

You can gain small rewards for your first 10 investments in each building, every day! Some workers will give you resources, speed up your quest times and more!

Let's have a closer look on these perks!

## Workers

The city's worker buildings are the main determinants of the maximum level our personal workers can go up to. These workers will give us a crafting speed bonus that starts at +1% at level 2.

In this photo, we can see that the Master Lodge at level 13 will allow Theodore to level up to 27 and will give me a 39% crafting speed bonus on all of Theodore's blueprints. Investing on the Master Lodge will speed up our current items on queue that Theodore crafts by 5% each click for 10x per day. A total of 50% off on crafting time. The same applies to other workers and their buildings.

## Resources

This is the type of building that produce our resources and determines how many of it we can get per minute in relation to its level. We have 10 types of resources: the primary ones, iron, wood, leather and herb; the secondaries which are steel, ironwood, fabric and oil; and our two new resources for tier 8, jewel and ether.

The number of bonus we get from investing in a Resource building is 10% of our personal resource bin's maximum capacity.

> _I have 4 pcs of Level 11 Iron bins that allows me to have a maximum amount of 440 pcs of iron when full and 10% of that is 44. Investing in the Iron Mine will give me +44 iron per click for 10x each day. The same principle applies to the rest of the resource buildings._
>
> _However, if you noticed, I can have a maximum of 175 ironwoods and 215 oil droplets. 10% of these would be 17.5 and 21.5 respectively, but I only get +17 and +21 when I invest on these buildings to get them._  

## Specials

We have 4 special buildings: the Town Hall; the Training Hall; the Emerald Inn; and, the Tavern.

The **Town Hall** manned by our own Elder Owen, determines the city's maximum capacity. At its max level, a city can hold 20 people. Investing in this building will give no daily bonus of any sort, but who doesn't want more people?!

The **Training Hall**, managed by Argon is tied to our hero levels. He does not give 10x daily bonuses, sure! But, Argon volunteered to train our heroes day and night, let's cut him some slack!

Oscar's **Emerald Inn** speeds up the healing rate of Heroes. It's pretty easy to max out at level 13, but we can still invest 10x a day to speed up our current resting heroes' healing time. Invest in this building if all or most of your heroes are currently resting to maximize the bonus.

Lastly, we have Naya's **Tavern**. This building increases loot found in quests, but the bonus it gives is different. Investing in the tavern 10x a day can cut upto 50% off the time of our running quests. It's best to invest in this building when your quest slots are full! From level 16, its Max level was bumped up to 19.
