### Introduction:

New Update! It's what we've all been waiting for, everyone! There's our Tier 8! New crafts to master and even more expensive stuff to sell! I can already smell the gold brewing extensively from here! But, what else does this update have in store for us? Hmm? Let's see!

### Decor!

**QUICKLY MAKE A LAYOUT WITH SPOOKY DECORS**

Since I got my shop fully expanded, I've been doing a lot of redecorating and even had my shop featured in the official facebook page! I don't have a lot of premium decors, sure! But I'm telling you, my decors and carpet inventory is lit!

Along with this update, we got Halloween decors for Spooktober! No kidding, I've been a fan of decorating since day one. While people are saving up for their upgrades and expansions, I was out buying plants, stained glass walls, torches, fireplaces and a fabulous couch!

With the update, we got **INSERT DECORS HERE**

For the update, we got **INSERT DECORS HERE**

### What's up?!

We have a new Dungeon called **Chronos Ruins.** It costs *!!!* to unlock, and will of course, like the previous dungeons, help us with crafting Tier 8 items! The items from there are called: 1, 2, and 3!

We also got 2 new NPCS that produce resources. Meet Serene and Maylee!

The cost to unlock them are as follows:

> Maylee:

> Serene: 

Serene produces ** and Maylee will give us **! More helpers, more fun!

### New and Improved way of Investing!

If you're a new player being held captive in a large guild, at least once in your game life you may have experienced not being able to get investment perks like additional resources and crafting boosts because a tap on a building will cost you your hard-earned hundreds of 
thousands to millions. But, not anymore!!!

Unlike before, Investments now count as a **"Tick."**

These **Ticks** replacing how buildings are upgraded is a REAL game changer. We still can't see how much this will affect a lot of cities with the grace period we're given to cover up on buildings that are lacking on them, but in the following days we're sure to see them! Luckily, buildings will only take a minute to upgrade! **Longest 60 seconds of my life.**

### The Academy's Scholar: Evelyn!

The 5% multicraft chance on enchantments brought by Evelyn is now changed into +25% Merchant XP bonus. Those who previously unlocked her received 50 Ascension Shards as compensation for this change.

So far, all I've seen from the community are protests about this change. According to some, they bought it for that 5% multicraft chance more than the wands themselves and crafting their own runestones. They most certainly did not expect 25% Merchant XP.

At higher levels, 50+ specifically, there's not much we can unlock anymore and if there were, they're very expensive gold-wise. People choose to just use gems instead. These gold amounts are doable, yes, but there is so much more we can do with anything above 100M like investing it on a building, for example. 

I don't have The Academy unlocked, but I agree with the others that Merchant XP becomes useless at some point. Our levels ain't gonna upgrade them buildings, extra enchantments from time to time will. So i'm throwing in a #JusticeForEvelyn!

### More!

But you know what I'm most happy about? The **MEOW!** sound! And of course, you can now tick on The Laboratory and The Academy even you we don't have them unlocked for yourself. It's gonna be really helpful as there are cities with very few members who has them and buildings do get expensive as they grow. More investors mean easier to upgrade buildings!

As one of the ancient players, probably the best **TIP** I can give you is adapt to these changes, learn to navigate around it and with it. Just change a few things on your play style. They always take our feedbacks into consideration, we've seen that happen countless times. However, things don't always change the way we want it to. So let's do what we can for now and trust the Game Gods' wisdom, shall we?! :)
