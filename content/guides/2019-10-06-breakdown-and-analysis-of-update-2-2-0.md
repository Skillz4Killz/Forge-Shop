### Introduction:

New Update! It's what we've all been waiting for, everyone! There's our Tier 8! New crafts to master and even more expensive stuff to sell! I can already smell the gold brewing extensively from here! But, what else does this update have in store for us? Hmm? Let's see!

### Decor!

**QUICKLY MAKE A LAYOUT WITH SPOOKY DECORS**

Since I got my shop fully expanded, I've been doing a lot of redecorating and even had my shop featured in the official facebook page! I don't have a lot of premium decors, sure! But I'm telling you, my decors and carpet inventory is lit!

Along with this update, we got Halloween decors for Spooktober! No kidding, I've been a fan of decorating since day one. While people are saving up for their upgrades and expansions, I was out buying plants, stained glass walls, torches, fireplaces and a fabulous couch!

For the update, we got **INSERT DECORS HERE**

### What's up?!

We have a new Dungeon called **Chronos Ruins.** It costs *!!!* to unlock, and will of course, like the previous dungeons, help us with crafting Tier 8 items! The items from there are called: 1, 2, and 3!

We also got 2 new NPCS that produce resources. Meet Serene and Maylee!! 


### New and Improved way of Investing!

The **Ticks**, as they call it now 


### The Academy's Scholar: Evelyn!

I don't have her, but I'm throwing in a #JusticeForEvelyn! for those who are unhappy about this change.

### More!

But you know what I'm most happy about? The **MEOW!** sound! And of course, I can now invest on Roxanne and Evelyn to help my guildies!

As one of the ancient players, probably the best **TIP** I can give you is adapt to these changes, learn to navigate around it. They always take our feedbacks into consideration, we've seen that happen. However, things don't always change the way we want it to. So let's do what we can for now and trust the Game Gods' wisdom, shall we?! :)
