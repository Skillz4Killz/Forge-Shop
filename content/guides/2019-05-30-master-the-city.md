# Creating Your Own City Versus Joining Another

## Introduction

Hey fellow shopkeepers, Skillz4Killz here from the Happy Hamlet City bringing you a guide on helping you master the city. Many players will also call the City a Guild and both are accurate. The game actually refers to it as both. For this guide, we will use the term: City!

## Creating Your Own City

1. So you want to make your own city? **Let's do it!**
2. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.
3. Click the **Finder** button.
4. Click **Create Guild.**
5. Pick a cool name for your City.
6. Click **Create.**

## **Joining Another City**

Joining another city is also an option. There are two ways to do it!

**Method 1: Using the Guild Finder**

1. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.
2. Click the **Finder** button.
3. Search for the name of the guild you want to join.
4. A dialogue box will ask if you're sure about joining this guild, simply tap **Yes.**

**Method 2: Accepting Invites**

1. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.
2. Click on **Invites.**
3. You will see a list of guild names, simply tap on an invite and **Join.**\
   > _(Note: You cannot see a guild's information other than how many members it currently has. It's best to ask around on world chat about the rank and building levels for more information about the guild if you need it.)_
4. The game will ask you if you're sure about joining this guild, simply tap **Yes.**

## Creating vs Joining: Which one is the best route?

Hi everyone! It's Angela, guildmaster of "Oh Idk." I've seen a lot of people asking about how they can leave their guilds, especially new players. There are only two options: Creating your own OR Joining another, which leads us to the next question: Which one is the most efficient path to take as a beginner?

The answer is simple: Join a pre-existing guild. As a starting player, you need access to higher resources and worker buildings for better progression. Your crafts shouldn't take too long in the beginning or take too much resources, but faster is always better if you want to progress quick.

Most guilds do require a certain investment level for them to allow you to join. Sure, but there are also starter guilds that will take you in no matter how much you have. The difference about newly-made guilds and well established ones is that, newer guilds thrive on how much a new player can instantly bring in to their guild upon joining, and not necessarily on how much you will be contributing in the future like well-established ones.

I made my own guild when I was in level 50s with 800M invested evenly throughout all the buildings. If you have plans on making your own guild in the future, the best way to prepare for it is to slowly invest in every building you have access to, get to a stable point in your shop where you have almost nothing to spend your coins on anymore and just actively invest.

It all comes down to how you want to play the game. If you want to be with other new players, it's fine. The only downside to that is your growth would be a little slower. As a guildmaster, you have buildings to invest on and worry about. Surely, if you want to be the best guildmaster in town, you don't want to pressure your members into investing. They're basically your in-game fam! Be a little more considerate as we all have a shop first before we have city buildings. We all can't invest much when we're not even making that much gold yet.

In the end, this is just a game and we're all here to have fun!

## Understanding City Investments

No matter whether you join or create your own city, you will need to learn everything about how investing in your city works. When you earn gold from your shop or from selling items in the market, you invest that gold into your city.

Investing gold, or gems, to improve your city is always helpful. If you were to leave your guild, those investments that you have made will be saved and carried with you to your new guild. So do not be afraid to invest as much as possible.

### Investing Guild Bonus

In the Guild Settings menu, you can select a worker to give the bonus to. Whenever, anyone in your guild invests to that worker they will be granted an extra 10% bonus to their investment.

The bonus can be moved every 8 hours. This is important to remember, because if a worker is close to leveling up, you don't want to move the bonus there because then you can not move it for 8 hours. Try to keep the bonus on buildings that require more money or the ones your guild is trying to focus on completing.

### Which Worker To Invest In

There is no "right" method of which worker to invest in. You can gain a small reward for each investment in a worker up to 10 times a day. Some workers will give you some resources, some will give speed up your quest times and more. Each worker is unique and you can see the benefits for investing in each one on the worker pages from the home page.

Whenever you can you should try and invest in the worker with the bonus as you get an extra 10% bonus investment.

## City Workers

In your city, there are three types of workers. The "producers" who will produce resources you will use to craft items in your shop. The "workers" who are required to craft those items. The "special" workers who provide other types of benefits.

To be able to invite more members to your guild, you have to invest into the Town Hall, Elder Owen. At this time, the maximum amount of guild members allowed in one guild is 20 members.

The worker's level is determined by the total sum of every member's investment in that worker.
