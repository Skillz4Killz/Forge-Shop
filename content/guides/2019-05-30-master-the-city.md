# Creating Your Own City Versus Joining Another

## Introduction

Hey fellow shopkeepers, Skillz4Killz here from the Happy Hamlet City bringing you a guide on helping you master the city. Many players will also call the City a Guild and both are accurate. The game actually refers to it as both. For this guide, we will use the term: City!

## Creating Your Own City

1. So you want to make your own city? **Let's do it!**
2. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.
3. Click the **Finder** button.
4. Click **Create Guild.**
5. Pick a cool name for your City.
6. Click **Create.**

## **Joining Another City**

Joining another city is also an option. There are two ways to do it!

**Method 1: Using the Guild Finder**

1. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.

   > _(**Note:** You cannot see a guild's information other than how many members it currently has. It's best to ask around on world chat about the rank and building levels for more information about the guild if you need it.)_
4. The game will ask you if you're sure about joining this guild, simply tap **Yes.**

## Creating vs Joining: Which one is the best route?

Hi everyone! It's Angela, guildmaster of "Oh Idk." I've seen a lot of people asking about how they can leave their guilds, especially new players. There are only two options: Creating your own OR Joining another, which leads us to the next question: Which one is the most efficient path to take as a beginner?

The answer is simple: Join a pre-existing guild. As a starting player, you need access to higher resources and worker buildings for better progression. Your crafts shouldn't take too long in the beginning or take too much resources, but faster is always better if you want to progress quick.

Most guilds do require a certain investment level for them to allow you to join. Sure, but there are also starter guilds that will take you in no matter how much you have. The difference about newly-made guilds and well established ones is that, newer guilds thrive on how much a new player can instantly bring in to their guild upon joining, and not necessarily on how much you will be contributing in the future like well-established ones.

I made my own guild when I was in level 50s with 800M invested evenly throughout all the buildings. If you have plans on making your own guild in the future, the best way to prepare for it is to slowly invest in every building you have access to, get to a stable point in your shop where you have almost nothing to spend your coins on anymore and just actively invest.

It all comes down to how you want to play the game. If you want to be with other new players, it's fine. The only downside to that is your growth would be a little slower. As a guildmaster, you have buildings to invest on and worry about. Surely, if you want to be the best guildmaster in town, you don't want to pressure your members into investing. They're basically your in-game fam! Be a little more considerate as we all have a shop first before we have city buildings. We all can't invest much when we're not even making that much gold yet.

In the end, this is just a game and we're all here to have fun!

## Understanding City Investments

One thing you also need to understand in the city is how investing works.

As you continue to earn in your shop or from selling items in the market, you will more than likely invest. It will help improve your city's buildings and overall productivity rates. However, do not be afraid to invest as much as possible. If you were to leave your guild, the investments you have made will be saved and carried with you to your new guild.

### Investing in Guild's Choice

In the Guild Settings menu, you can select a building to put the guild's choice. As you invest in the chosen building, you will be granted an extra 10% bonus to your investments.

> _(**Note**: Here, you will see the difference of investment logged in Wood Workshop vs Wizard Tower. The current Guild's Choice is Wizard Tower. Hence, the extra 100,000 on it. The 10% of 1,000,000.)_

The Guild's Choice can be moved by the guild masters and officers every 8 hours. This is important to remember because as the building is getting close to leveling up, you may not want to move the bonus there or you will wait 8 hours to choose another. Try to keep the bonus on buildings that require more money or the ones your guild is trying to focus on completing.

Here are two ways to move the Guild's Choice:

**A. Clicking on a building.** In this walk through, we will use Katarina/Jeweler as an example.

## Types of Buildings

A building's level is determined by the total sum of every member's investment in that building. In your city, there are three types of it: Worker, Resource and Special buildings. You can gain small rewards for your first 10 investments in each building, every day! Some workers will give you some resources, some will give speed up your quest times and more. Below, we'll have a closer look on these perks!

### Worker Buildings

### Resource Buildings

This is the type of building that produce our resources and determines how many of it we get per minute according to its level. Currently, we have 8 types of resources. The primary ones: iron, wood, leather and herb; and, the secondaries are steel, ironwood, fabric and oil.

The number of bonus we get from investing in a Resource building is 10% of our bin's maximum capacity.

> _I have 4pcs of Level 11 Iron bins that allows me to have a maximum amount of 440pcs of iron when full and 10%  of that is 44. Investing in the Iron Mine will give me +44 iron/tap for 10x each day._

### Special Buildings

We have 4 special buildings: the Town Hall; the Training Hall; the Emerald Inn; and, the Tavern.

The **Town Hall** manned by our own Elder Owen, determines the guild's maximum capacity. At its max level, a guild can hold 20 people. Investing in this building will give no daily bonus of any sort, but who doesn't want more people in their guild?!

The **Training Hall**, managed by Argon is tied to our hero levels. He doesn't give daily bonuses, sure. But Argon volunteered to train our heroes day and night, let's cut him some slack!

Oscar's **Emerald Inn** speeds up the healing rate of Heroes. Most guilds already has the inn maxed out at Level 11, but we can still invest 10x a day to speed up our current resting heroes' healing time. Invest in this building if all or most of your heroes are currently resting to maximize the bonus.

Lastly, we have Naya's **Tavern**. This building increases loot found in quests, but like the inn, many guilds already have the Tavern maxed out at Level 16. Investing in the tavern 10x a day can cut upto 50% of our running quests. It's best to invest in this building when your quest slots are full!
