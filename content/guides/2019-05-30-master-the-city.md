# Creating Your Own City Versus Joining Another

## Introduction

Hey fellow shopkeepers, Skillz4Killz here from the Happy Hamlet City bringing you a guide on helping you master the city. Many players will also call the City a Guild and both are accurate. The game actually refers to it as both. For this guide, we will use the term: City!

## Creating Your Own City

So you want to make your own city? **Let's do it!**

1. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.
2. Click the **Finder** button.
3. Click **Create Guild.**
4. Pick a name for your City.
5. Click **Create.**

## **Joining Another City**

Joining another city is also an option. There are two ways to do it!

**Method 1: Using the Guild Finder**

1. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.
2. Click the **Finder** button.
3. Search for the name of the guild you want to join.
4. A dialogue box will ask if you're sure about joining this guild, simply tap **Yes.**

**Method 2: Accepting Invites**

1. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.
2. Click on **Invites.**
3. You will see a list of guild names, simply tap on an invite and **Join.**\
   _(Note: You cannot see a guild's information other than how many members it currently has. It's best to ask around on world chat about the guild rank and building levels for more information.)_
4. The game will ask you if you're sure about joining this guild, simply tap **Yes.**
