# Creating Your Own City Versus Joining Another

## Introduction

Hey fellow shopkeepers, Skillz4Killz here from the Happy Hamlet City bringing you a guide on helping you master the city. Many players will also call the City a Guild and both are accurate. The game actually refers to it as both. For this guide, we will use the term: City!

## Creating Your Own City

So you want to make your own city? **Let's do it!**

1. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.
2. Click the **Finder** button.
3. Click **Create Guild.**
4. Pick a name for your City.
5. Click **Create.**

## **Joining Another City**

Joining another city is also an option. There are two ways to do it!

**Method 1: Using the Guild Finder**

1. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.
2. Click the **Finder** button.
3. Search for the name of the guild you want to join.
4. A dialogue box will ask if you're sure about joining this guild, simply tap **Yes.**

**Method 2: Accepting Invites**

1. Go into the **City** screen and click the **Guild** banner.
2. Click on **Invites.**
3. You will see a list of guild names, simply tap on an invite and **Join.**\
   _(Note: You cannot see a guild's information other than how many members it currently has. It's best to ask around on world chat about the guild rank and building levels for more information.)_
4. The game will ask you if you're sure about joining this guild, simply tap **Yes.**

## Creating vs Joining: Which one is the best route?

Hi everyone! Angela here, guildmaster of "Oh Idk." I've seen a lot of people asking about how they can leave their guilds, especially new players. There are only two options: Creating your own OR Joining another which leads us to the next question: Which one is the most efficient path to take as a beginner?

The answer is simple: Join a pre-existing guild. As a starting player, you need access to higher resources and worker buildings for better progression. Your crafts shouldn't take too long in the beginning or take too much resources, but faster is always better if you want to progress quick.

Most guilds do require a certain investment level for them to allow you to join. Sure, but there are also starter guilds that will take you in no matter how much you have. The difference about newly-made guilds and well established ones is that, newer guilds thrive on how much a new player can instantly bring in to their guild upon joining, and not necessarily on how much you will be contributing in the future like well-established ones.

I made my own guild when I was in level 50s with 800M invested evenly throughout all the buildings. If you have plans on making your own guild in the future, the best way to prepare for it is to slowly invest in all the buildings and get to a stable point in your shop where you have almost nothing to spend your coins anymore and just actively invest.

It all comes down to how you want to play the game. If you want to be with other new players, it's fine. The only downside to that is your growth would be a little slower because as a guildmaster, you have buildings to invest on and worry about. Surely, if you want to be the best guildmaster in town, you don't want pressure your members to invest. They're basically your in-game fam! Be a little more considerate as we all have a shop first before we have city buildings. We all can't invest much when we're not even making that much gold yet.

In the end, this is just a game and we're all here to have fun!
