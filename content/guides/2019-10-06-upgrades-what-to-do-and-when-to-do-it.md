  Racks vs Bins vs Counter: The never ending dilemma and some other tips! (Yes,
  TIPS)
---
## Introduction

Meow y'all! It's Angela (again.) At early stages in the game and even later on, our earned funds can always be a little tight. Even in higher levels, we do have the gold for it but it's still expensive AND time consuming. We still find ourselves asking: Which furniture should I do first?

So today, we'll talk about upgrades and when to hit them!

### Racks

We have four types: Vertical Racks, Table, Shelves and Mannequins. You probably didn't think much about how many of each you have. You just wanted the additional energy they give, right? That's basically the purpose of upgrading them.

>> **TIP!** Planning your racks based on what you usually craft is also a way to keep your racks full. For example, I mainly craft spears and potions. My fodders are rings, amulets and scrolls! I never have to worry about keeping my racks full, because spears and potions go to where they need to be. The tables I have are hidden from customers so they can't sweep off its contents. It's kept in my shop for when I craft shields, daggers and bows for tasks, additional energy AND maintaining heavy customer flow!> > Upgrading racks increases our maximum energy cap and gives us more energy per smalltalk. That's the main point of having the highest maximum amount of energy you can get your hands on. Small Talk successes grants +10% energy  from what you're missing to maximum.

This is just from small talk. You should also have items you discount and sell for additional energy. 

Now, to decide if your current maximum energy is enough for smooth selling, you need to know what your highest selling items require for Surcharge Energy. For players who did not buy the Engineer (Roxanne), our current highest-selling item would be the Tier 7 spear, Royal Halberd which requires 480 energy to surcharge.

Some players aim for just a little over 480, I say AIM HIGHER. By that, I mean 960 energy (double the 480) and higher. In this example, our maximum energy is set to 1,000 and I will use Hauberk, a T4 Heavy Armor for discount (+45) and my counter is level 12, which gives +21 energy per sale.

>> **Starting from 0/1000**

>>> Small Talk 1: **100**/1000

>>> Discount (+45): **145**/1000

>>> Sell (+21): **166**/1000

>>> Small Talk 2: **294**/1000

>>> Discount and Sell (45+21=66): **360**/1000

>>> Small Talk 3: **424**/1000

>>> Discount and Sell (+66): **490/1000**

From there you will see, I only needed 3 successful small talks and 3 Hauberks to sell 1 Halberd. Not having a high enough energy will require 

To terrorize you further, check this small talk chart for people who has 100 as their maximum amount and imagine how many continuously successful small talks they need just to surcharge Scroll of Sparks, a tier 3 scroll that requires 85 energy:

>>> **TIP!** Why I'm saying this is that: It's dangerous and/or risky to small talk when your energy is already over 50%. It's not confirmed if the chances for backfire rises as our energy gets higher BUT, unlike small talk, backfire deduction is not based on the maximum amount of energy you have. Meaning, the higher current energy you have, the greater you will lose from a single backfire.

>>> _(Explanation: When I computed a few backfires, the current energy deducted from the previously higher one is not consistent. The percent values being deducted ranged from 27-30% of current energy.)_

### Bins

Our lovely, lovely bins. They are essential for our crafting needs. Upgrading them and making sure you have the maximum amount possible is highly beneficial. This 

Here, we will use Royal Halberd as example:

In the charts, you will see that I can craft 4 Royal Halberds every 33 minutes because my bins are big enough to craft them initially from zero. The resource regeneration also plays a huge part on this process.

Didn't get it? Same! Not everyone likes Math and numbers, so to sum it up:

### Counter

I consider the counter to be a long term investment in our shops. Most people don't upgrade this until they're stable enough on profit to afford upgrading the counter.

>> **Tip?!** Maybe! People keep asking though, how to make a lot of money? It's a combination of these 3. Balance. Your racks providing you--

### Your Guild can HELP you!

Once you've helped a member on a furniture, you can't help them for that upgrade anymore unless you wanna rush their upgrade with gems. A player can only receive a maximum of 5 helps per furniture upgrade. 

There are instances when you can help them twice, but only if they have both a furniture upgrade and a shop expansion going on at the same time. Again, just 5 helps. Once they get their 5 helps from other guild members, you can't help them anymore.

>> **Tip!** This is usually done in bigger guilds where most players' upgrades take days to finish: Rushing each other's upgrades with gems! Did you know that upgrading a furniture with gold+gems is cheaper? (gem-wise, of course.) We usually buy an upgrade with gold and after 5 helps, rush it with gems ourselves. But, !!
